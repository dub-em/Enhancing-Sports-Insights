Workflow
-National games, how this can be accounted for?

Client Desired Pattern
Analysis

Historic match score & Referee - Done
-Repeated sequences
	-Even similar patterns
	-Limited to the last six game
		Head2Head, Home and Away
	-Expected pattern is limited to 3 games (after third occurence, pattern is expected to change)
		-Client should be notifed when the pattern is at the second stage
		-Check if total score is the same regardless of which team plays home or away
		-Check if total score is the same regarding which team playes home or away (filter basically)
		-Check if there is a repitition or other pattern like (score increment) for home team, also for away team.	
		-Check for number in between if both number are not consecutive.

	-Filter for home only played
	-Filter for away only played
	-Allign the score of team under consideration regardless of home or away and check
	-Don't filter or allign at all, and check by role
	
What happened during the games -Done
-Which minute of scoring occurs the most
	-Check exact minute
	-Also check by ranges
		-injury time
		-first ten minutes
		-last ten minutes
		-first and second half
-Compare between the two teams playing against each other
	-Who scores more with respect to first goal or the last
-Check if a team is always winning even though the opponent scored first.

Final Steps
-Investigate why there were no extractions for the other leagues.
-Try using round for extraction instead


Project Expansions
-Historic Analysis -Done
	Milestone
	-Database Creation and Historic Data Extraction (Allocation: EUR550, Date: 6th - 17th) -Done
	-Data Wrangling and Preparation, Outcome Prediction (Allocation: EUR550, Date: 18th - 28th) -Done
	-Analysis of Prediction, Report of Analysis (Allocation: EUR500, Date: 29th - 10th) -Done

	Report	
	-Part 1: https://www.loom.com/share/6ab43dcccd2a42e9a93f0a0ae78e4363?sid=cc130e11-0e77-4428-acad-4ebf3c38be6b

-Rule Check -Done
	Milestone
	-Defining Rules and System Integration (Allocation: EUR250, Date: 6th - 14th) -Done
	-Deployment (Allocation: EUR250, Date: 15th - 23rd) -Done

Bonus Dependent on timely execution: EUR200 -Certain


-Real-time Check -Pending
	-All already played matches will be extracted and the actual score will be checked against the system's prediction
		-Whichever system prediction happens to be right, the source of the prediction will be documented
	-Over time, Analysis will be conducted to see which sources leads to the most successful predictions
	

Historic Analysis ToDo
-Parts of the report like league and team accuracies and prediction types can be incorporated into the User Interface
-Check and correct the ml stats extraction script.

-Rules Check ToDo
-Implement a threshold relaxation in the event that number of predictions is less than 5, then threshold should be 70% -Done
-Correct the rules check analysis, where the count will be refreshed for every new row.
-In addition to the email update on number of prediction, also notify the client of any match that has less than 5 predicitons
-An added priority list that show the matches (top 5) that have the highest number of rules as true. 
-Implement new set of rules check asked for by the client.

New Project ToDo
-Check the bet sites to see what it take to extract their odds daily
-How matches in the bet site can be linked to the matches in the systems prediciton
-Adding the odds to rules checked, and outputing the matches with the highest odd attached to their rule check with true value
