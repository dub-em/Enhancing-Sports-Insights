Workflow
-National games, how this can be accounted for?

Client Desired Pattern
Analysis

Historic match score & Referee - Done
-Repeated sequences
	-Even similar patterns
	-Limited to the last six game
		Head2Head, Home and Away
	-Expected pattern is limited to 3 games (after third occurence, pattern is expected to change)
		-Client should be notifed when the pattern is at the second stage
		-Check if total score is the same regardless of which team plays home or away
		-Check if total score is the same regarding which team playes home or away (filter basically)
		-Check if there is a repitition or other pattern like (score increment) for home team, also for away team.	
		-Check for number in between if both number are not consecutive.

	-Filter for home only played
	-Filter for away only played
	-Allign the score of team under consideration regardless of home or away and check
	-Don't filter or allign at all, and check by role
	
What happened during the games -Done
-Which minute of scoring occurs the most
	-Check exact minute
	-Also check by ranges
		-injury time
		-first ten minutes
		-last ten minutes
		-first and second half
-Compare between the two teams playing against each other
	-Who scores more with respect to first goal or the last
-Check if a team is always winning even though the opponent scored first.

Final Steps
-Investigate why there were no extractions for the other leagues.
-Try using round for extraction instead


Project Expansions
-Historic Analysis
	Milestone
	-Database Creation and Historic Data Extraction (Allocation: EUR550, Date: 6th - 17th) -Done
	-Data Wrangling and Preparation, Outcome Prediction (Allocation: EUR550, Date: 18th - 28th) -Done
	-Analysis of Prediction, Report of Analysis (Allocation: EUR500, Date: 29th - 10th) -Report Writing Ongoing

-Historic Analysis to see the performance of the Predictions
	Milestone
	-Database to hold large amount of data as each league will be analysed by their participating clubs
		-Each club will have it's own historic data extracted from the league's historic data
	-Historic matches will be extracted
		-Each club in each historic match will be checked against its own history for home or away history
		-Both clubs in the match will be used to filter the historic match for head-to-head
	-Prediction will be made on all match after the data transformation is done.
	-Analysis on this Predcition will be done, by entire dataset, by league, and possibly by season 

-Rule Check -Done
	Milestone
	-Defining Rules and System Integration (Allocation: EUR250, Date: 6th - 14th) -Done
	-Deployment (Allocation: EUR250, Date: 15th - 23rd) -Done
		-Add the rules check to the Analysis script
		-This will lead to combining the Team and Ref prediction at the analysis stage, to create a rules_check table which is a combination of both -Done, but put on hold dur to client's request.
		-When extracting data from database (rules check table) to display on the UI, filter by the matches that passed the rule from analysis.

-Real Check 
	-All predictions from client will be checked against the already existing prediction from the system
		-The overlapping predictions will be check and confirmed if the system supports it, and by how much percentage probability.

Bonus Dependent on timely execution: EUR200


-Real-time Crosschecking Platform Prediction
	-All already played matches will be extracted and the actual score will be checked against the system's prediction
		-Whichever system prediction happens to be right, the source of the prediction will be documented
	-Over time, Analysis will be conducted to see which sources leads to the most successful predictions.


ToDo
-Create Report for Client on Conducted Analysis
	-What was the overall accuracy
	-What was the accuracy by leagues
		-Which leagues had the top 5 accurate prediction
	-What was the accuracy by seasons
	-What was the accuracy by seasons and leagues
		-Given the top 5 leagues in each season, which leagues were reoccuring
	-Which prediction sources occured the most in accurate predictions
	-which prediction sources were occured most (top 5) in accurate predictions for each league.
	-Which predictions sources occured the most (top 5) in accurate predictions for each season
	-Which teams had the most occurence in accurate predictions
	-Which teams had the highest accuracy from all their occurences
	-Which teams amongst the highest occuring in accurate predicitons had the highest accuracy.
	-Which teams had the most occurence (top 5) in accurate predicitons by season
	-Which team has the highest accuracy(top 5) from all their occurences by season
	-Is there any trend pattern by weekly accuracy, by season for each league
		-Plot six season leagues in one cahrt each
	-Which leagues had the highest upward gradient in weekly accuracy trend.

-Proposal
	-Parts of the report like league and team accuracies and prediction types can be incorporated into the User Interface


-Arrange the Enhance Sport Repo
	-Add all of Michael Georges Code to sub-branch_1
	-Add all of my codes to sub_branch_2
	-Delete all branches
	-Push to main branch
